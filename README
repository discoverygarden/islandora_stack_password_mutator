This script is meant to make the process of changing Islandora's mysql stack passwords easier.
will likely need to set root@localhost, fedoraAdmin@%, fedoraAdmin@localhost, drupal@localhost

sql_user_pass.input contains sets of mysql users(with hosts) and passwords
drupal_fedora_users.input contains a mapping of the fedora and drupal users to their mysql counterparts
These files are simply examples/test and will need to be changed to match your users/passwords
mysql users are specified thus: 'fedoraAdmin'@'localhost'

may have to call using sudo -E sh ./mutate_islandora_stack_passwords.sh
